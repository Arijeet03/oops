// 3.	Create code snippets that illustrates the use of scope resolution operator (: :) for the following uses:
/*a.	Member functions defined outside class
b.	To access a global variable when there is a local variable with same name
c.	To access a classâ€™s static variables
d.	Including in-built libraries
*/
